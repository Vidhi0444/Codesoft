"Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the creation of a Portfolio Calculator and a captivating Landing Page using the dynamic trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
In this repository, you'll find the code and resources I've meticulously crafted to help you calculate the potential growth of your investment portfolio. 
The Portfolio Calculator utilizes JavaScript to perform real-time calculations based on your inputs, making financial planning a breeze.
But that's not all! I've also designed a visually stunning Landing Page that not only introduces the Portfolio Calculator but also serves as a delightful entry point to your journey.
The Landing Page is powered by HTML and CSS to deliver an engaging user experience, ensuring that your visitors are not only informed but also captivated.
Feel free to explore the code, customize it to your heart's content, and take your first steps towards mastering web development with this exciting project. Happy coding!"
